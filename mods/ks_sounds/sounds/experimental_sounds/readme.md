# Experimental Sounds
I'm literally making sounds by smacking my computer around with various objects. Obviously, not all of these sounds are going to be home runs, so I got to weed out the bad ones and keep the good ones.

Note to self: Get that pickaxe and brick out so you can stop smacking your poor computer.

Second Note to self: Do it already! There haven't been any updates for a good week or so!
